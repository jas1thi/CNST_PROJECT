# Surface Crack Detection using CNN

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras to automatically detect surface cracks in construction materials, using a balanced dataset of 40,000 images from Kaggle. Applied image preprocessing, data augmentation, and binary classification techniques, achieving accurate identification of crack vs. no-crack conditions. Evaluated performance using confusion matrices and classification reports, and visualized model accuracy/loss over epochs. The model demonstrated strong applicability in civil engineering, infrastructure inspection, and non-destructive testing.
